# WaveICA
Removal of batch effects for large-scale untargeted metabolomics data based on wavelet analysis.
The WaveICA R package provides a new algorithm to removing batch effects for metabolomics data. The details of this method are in the paper "WaveICA: a novel algorithm to remove batch effects for large-scale untargeted metabolomics data based on wavelet analysis".
